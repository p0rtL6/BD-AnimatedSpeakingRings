# How to use the spinning music bot function
using a plugin like [EditUsers](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/EditUsers) by DevilBro:
1. Grab whatever image you want to use (I use a picture of a record)
2. Change the file name to mbotdisc
3. Change the music bot's profile picture to this file
4. Now you will have a spinning disc as your music plays!
